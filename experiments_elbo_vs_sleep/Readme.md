This folder contains the scripts to reproduce the results in Section 5. 

Here, we compare the performance of traditional ELBO optimization against sleep optimization on a simple synthetic image. 

The fits are pre-saved in the `./fits/` folder. 

To produce Figures 5 and 6, see `./jupyter/sleep_elbo_compare.ipynb`. To produce Figure 7, see `./jupyter/sleep_elbo_compare-100x100.ipynb`.

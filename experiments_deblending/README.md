This folder contains a simple example of sleep phase training. Run 

> `python train_encoder.py`

which will fit a variational distribution on sleep-phase simulated data. 
The simulated data are 7 x 7 tiles with either one or two stars.

See `./experiments_deblending/deblending_experiment.ipynb` to load the fitted variational distribution and print results.
